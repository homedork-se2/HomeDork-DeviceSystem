# HomeDork-DeviceSystem
This is the HomeDork repository for the Arduino and device system. 

To add the classes to the arduino library you must make a folder with the name of the 
class with associated file name.h file and name.cpp file inside the arduino library.
The arduino library is located in the Arduino folder. Once the folder is created and the
files are in you go to where you run the arduino located at the top you have File, Edit, 
Sketch click on Sketch scroll down to include library then select the library. If the 
arduinomain contains #include <name.h> then the library is included in the build.
